# PriVELT

Android application to centralise known data from different services. The project is funded by PriVELT (https://privelt.ac.uk/).
PriVELT aims to make travellers aware of the risks of the Internet. The application collect all private data known by the different services (see Services supported),
to inform the user and help him to reduce his privacy risks. PriVELT also monitor local installed applications by checking all the permissions they are asking for,
and which permissions are granted by the user. PriVELT does not have a remote server, so all the information is hold locally on the device user.
The local database is secured with a password known and chosen only by the user. PriVELT also have scores and charts to help the user to understand the privacy issues he is facing.
